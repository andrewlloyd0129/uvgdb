TODO:

*CRUD*
- Next steps for people, probably wire them up to belong to games and studios as well as give them titles
- wire platforms to games (so this sucks.  ask brayden wtf is going on with has and belongs to many relationships and how to use them)
- wire characters to games
- in crud for games add carrierwave for photos.  One feature pic, and other pics

*USERS*
- user profile page
- devise users to favorite games, add as beat story, add as beat 100%,  add to wishlist, also can submit new content - games characters etc,   you can like games (act as votable)
- admin user (petergate) to approve any content submissions from users

*Nav Bar*
- Logo for uvgdb
- global serch bar
- Drop down menu for what you are searching
- nav bar for links to: Characters Random-Page

*Other Crap*
- page for top 10 games this week, this month, all time
- add gritter and make them show up (currently if you cannot create a new game it fails silently)
- add kaminari to paginate big pages, example: if one studio has a butt ton of games, paginate them   use this kaminari so it works     play around with different views for pagination ex. rails generate kaminari:views bootstrap3
- make it so anyome can make games, studios, characters etc but admins have to approve them.
- create admin dashboard that shows all pending characters, studios and games that are pending approval
- On games show page, if game was released in past x years, add month to year
- Weston sucks cock
