TODO:

*CRUD*
- On games show page, if game was released in past x years, add month to year
- CRUD for platforms
- CRUD for Studio'
- CRUD for Characters



*USERS*
- sign in/ sign out pages
- admin user

*Search Bar*
- Drop down menu for what you are searching

*Other Crap*
- add gritter and make them show up (currently if you cannot create a new game it fails silently)
- add kaminari to paginate big pages, example: if one studio has a butt ton of games, paginate them   use this kaminari so it works gem 'kaminari', :git => 'https://github.com/kaminari/kaminari.git'     play around with different views for pagination ex. rails generate kaminari:views bootstrap3
- make it so anyome can make games, studios, characters etc but admins have to approve them.
- create admin dashboard that shows all pending characters, studios and games that are pending approval
