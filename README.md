TODO:

*CRUD*
- Next steps for people, probably wire them up to belong to games and studios as well as give them titles
- wire characters to games
- in crud for games add carrierwave for photos.  One feature pic, and other pics
- Platform validation on creation for multiple platforms
- Gamplat - Refactor platform and game views, Update game form to have a dropdown menu for gamplat

*USERS*
- User profile page
- Admin Dashboard page
  • Pending content for review
  • Edit users
- Users can add games as:
  • Favorited
  • Story Beaten
  • 100% Complete
  • Owned but not played
  • Wishlist
- Users can submit new content for review by admin - games characters etc
- Users can like/dislike games (act as votable)
- Admin user to approve any content submissions from users

*Nav Bar*
- Dropdown menu
  • User page link
  • Admin page link
- Logo for uvgdb
- Search bar
  • Dropdown menu for specific search
  • Global search for all items
- Nav bar links
  • Random-Page

*Ransack*
- Figure out how to format seaching as "a to z" for text but as "old to new" for dates
- Figure out how to search by dates...

*Other Crap*
- page for top 10 games this week, this month, all time
- add gritter and make them show up (currently if you cannot create a new game it fails silently)
- On games show page, if game was released in past x years, add month to year
- Implement functinoality so when the user goes back to a page it carries over their search for the page (I.e search halo on games page, click halo 2 show page, go click games page goes back to search for halo)
- I found this library for carrierwaive and stuff for pictures and videos.  https://rails.devcamp.com/trails/dissecting-rails-5/campsites/images-videos-rails-5
